## Description

**3xcalibur** is a decentralized exchange and liquidity protocol on Arbitrum nitro.  
It is a fork of the Solidly protocol, which notably introduced $ x3y + y3x = k $ pools for concentrated stable-swaps, and improved on the Curve's emission mechanism.  
  
We further improved on Solidly by allowing to use more complex emisson schedule strategies, added modifications to the governance mechanism, added convenience contracts to improve user experience, correcting bugs and redesigned tokenomics.  

## Tokens

The **XCAL** token is an ERC20 token with 18 decimals.  
It is the main token of the protocol.  
It can be locked in exchange for a VeNFT token that grants user voting power to direct the protocol's emissions, proportional to the locked amount and lock duration.

**VeNFTs** are ERC721 tokens.  
They encode the amount and duration of the lock, and can be transferred to other users.  
Can be used to direct emissions by voting for gauges (through the [Voter](contracts/periphery/Voter.sol) contract).  

**LP tokens** are ERC20 tokens.  
They represent a share in a liquidity pool.

## Deployment

Set environment variables in a .env file:

```bash
$ export PRIVATE_KEY=<ur private key>
$ export ALCHEMY_API_KEY=<your alchemy api key>
```

In root of repo:

```bash
$ yarn
$ npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.ts [--network <network>]
```

Deployed addresses will be in `./scipts/config/<network>.json`

## Tests

The test suite uses the [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) framework.  

to install foundry, run:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

to run the test files, first install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit
forge install transmissions11/solmate --no-commit
```

Launch a forked blockchain instance at port `http://127.0.0.1:8545/`:

```bash
# example
anvil -f https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
```

then call

```bash
forge test --force
```

To get code coverage:

```bash
forge coverage
```
